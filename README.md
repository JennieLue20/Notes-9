and cost-effective.
#Realiability;
The ability of your system to perform its intended purpose correctly and consistently when expected is measured by its reliability.
MTBF=Time between failures - total time in service divided by number of failure
MTTF= time to failure - time taken to repair system 
MTTR= time to repair - time taken to repair system 
#Availability;
Availability = Available for use time / total time 
//Keyterms;
